# Cross-version state upgrades

Malink treats an application update as a state transition, not as a fresh
start. This applies to online PWA updates, Android cover installs, Gateway
releases, and future desktop clients.

## State classes

Every persistent store must be registered as exactly one class:

| Class | Examples | Version change policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security-critical | device identity, trust, replay ledger, Matrix login | Run every explicit `N -> N+1` migration. Preserve and enter repair if a step or validation is unavailable. Never delete automatically. |
| Durable command | native command outbox, unfinished pairing transaction | Run every explicit idempotent migration. Quarantine an ambiguous command only when its owning protocol defines a non-replayable tombstone. Never manufacture or resend a replacement command. |
| Rebuildable projection | conversation history cache, event cursor, Matrix sync projection | Reset only this projection when its schema changes or validation fails, then rebuild it from authenticated Matrix state/timeline. |
| Ephemeral UI | selected session, disclosure/read preferences | Reset the affected preference when incompatible. It must never block connection or execution. |

The state class itself is durable metadata. Changing a store from one class to
another requires a manifest migration and review; it must not happen merely by
editing the current catalog entry.

## Upgrade transaction

Before any business UI, Matrix connection, native bridge subscription, or
Gateway command processing starts, the owning runtime performs:

1. Read the upgrade manifest and reject a manifest from a newer incompatible
   runtime rather than attempting a downgrade.
2. Write a `running` journal containing the source version of every store.
3. For each store, write the active `N -> N+1` step, run its idempotent
   migration, validate the result, and atomically checkpoint the new version.
4. Reset only incompatible rebuildable/ephemeral state.
5. Reconcile durable commands with the authenticated MLP/3 event chain and
   reconstruct projections from the signed current pointer, Matrix threads,
   and thread relations.
6. Write `complete` and unlock the runtime.

If the process stops after a store write but before its checkpoint, the active
adjacent step is replayed. Therefore every migration must accept both its exact
source representation and the already-migrated result produced by a previous
interrupted attempt.

Web localStorage and IndexedDB have separate journals because their atomicity
boundaries differ. Android keeps one journal beside the encrypted native
stores and another beside the Matrix-account stores. Gateway JSON/WAL/SQLite
stores carry their own schema version and use the same adjacent-migration rule.
The MLP/3 command journal migration is deliberately forward-only: JSONL v1 is
imported into SQLite v2 in one transaction, retained unchanged and hash-bound
as historical evidence, but never opened for active command processing again.

## Version boundaries

The following versions are independent and must not be inferred from a build
number:

- PWA local-storage manifest and each local store;
- PWA IndexedDB manifest and each database;
- Android native manifest and each encrypted store;
- Android Matrix-account manifest and each account store;
- Gateway runtime/outbox/replay file schemas;
- Malink Protocol (`MALINK_PROTOCOL_VERSION`);
- Web/native bridge protocol (`NATIVE_BRIDGE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`).

A build ID is diagnostic metadata. Store versions decide migration; protocol
versions describe a genuine compatibility boundary between concurrently
running components; they are not counters for semantic or implementation
changes. Additive optional behavior stays on the current version when old
peers can reject or ignore it safely and new peers retain a useful fallback.
Native bridge versions are negotiated, but negotiation must widen compatible
operation rather than turn a supported older peer into an update dead end.
MLP/3 application events fail
closed when their authenticated version is unsupported; a storage migration
must not silently reinterpret a different wire protocol or reconnect a v2 data
plane. Pairing is independently versioned because it establishes the trust and
key material needed before application events can be opened.

## Release rule

For every release that changes persistent state:

1. Increase only the affected store version.
2. Register and test every adjacent migration from every supported released
   version. A device may jump from `N` to `N+3`; startup must run the complete
   `N -> N+1 -> N+2 -> N+3` chain without requiring intermediate APK installs.
3. Keep the previous release fixture. Do not rewrite it to resemble the new
   schema.
4. Prove: normal upgrade, process death during every new step, restart/resume,
   rollback refusal for security/durable state, projection rebuild, and normal
   create/prompt/history/delete business flows after upgrade.
5. Android validation must use `adb install -r` so application data, Keystore
   keys, Matrix login, and outboxes actually survive the update.
6. A migration is not accepted if only codec unit tests pass. The Web live E2E
   and Android Alpha E2E must finish business commands after the upgraded state
   reaches `complete`.
7. The native release path must also pass `test:e2e:android-update`: install an
   older `.e2e` APK, inject the same account release object published by the
   Gateway, cover-install it with `PackageInstaller`, prove application data
   survived, and prove the new build converged stale update cache. Gateway
   tests separately prove durable admin publication into `workspace.snapshot`.
8. A bridge/capability version increase must include bidirectional released-peer
   fixtures and a staged rollout test. The newest online PWA must retain a
   working path for the oldest supported APK, especially when that path is
   responsible for installing the new APK.

Adding a new persistent key/database without adding it to the owning catalog is
a release-blocking defect.

The fixture represents an actually shipped release. After a release it is
immutable: the next release adds a new fixture instead of editing the old one.
CI compares every retained fixture with the current catalogs, so an application
that skips a migration from any supported installed version cannot ship.

## Corruption and rollback

The manifest is not permission to trust source data. Stores are validated on
every startup even when the build ID and recorded schemas are unchanged. A
valid completed journal therefore cannot hide a subsequently damaged trust,
identity, replay, or command store.

An unreadable journal means the source versions are unknown. Security-critical
and durable-command stores are preserved and the runtime remains repair-only;
they are never relabelled as the current schema. If no protected state exists,
only rebuildable projections and ephemeral UI are reset and a new baseline is
created. Android `AtomicFile` recovery is attempted first; if both journal
copies are unreadable, startup fails closed and diagnostics identify the
upgrade journal rather than deleting encrypted stores.

Installing an older PWA/APK/Gateway over newer protected state is also a repair
condition, not a reverse migration. Explicit reverse migrations may be added
later, but an ordinary forward migration must never be run backwards.

The online Gateway supervisor consequently uses automatic rollback only when
every current security-critical and durable-command catalog entry exists in
the target release with the same class and schema version. Rebuildable and
ephemeral stores may change under their normal reset/rebuild rules. A protected
schema migration or new protected store is classified as forward-only: it may
be prepared, but activation requires a second explicit confirmation, a verified
backup taken while the Gateway is stopped, and automatic binary rollback is
disabled. If the target has touched state and fails, it remains stopped for
repair; the older release is never restarted against the new format. Missing
catalog entries and state-class changes remain release-blocking defects.

The SQLite command-journal release is such a protected-store addition. It must
use a maintenance rollout with automatic rollback disabled: an older Gateway
would otherwise resume appending the now-historical JSONL and create two local
execution authorities. Supervisors older than this forward-only mechanism need
one local external bootstrap; after that release, later protected migrations
use the ordinary signed stage plus explicit forward-only apply flow.
