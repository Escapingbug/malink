# rustls-platform-verifier Android component

This module vendors the production JVM component from
`rustls-platform-verifier-android` 0.1.1 at upstream commit
`1099f161bfc5e3ac7f90aad88b1bf788e72906cb`.

It is paired with `rustls-platform-verifier` 0.6.2 linked into Matrix Rust SDK
26.07.28. The Matrix SDK AAR omits this required companion component from its
published dependency metadata, so the application must package it explicitly.

Malink applies the Android CRL selection from upstream PR #179 and permits
cleartext only for Let's Encrypt's `c.lencr.org` CRL host. This preserves
revocation checking for Let's Encrypt certificates without enabling cleartext
application traffic globally.
