/**
 * Commits SDK timeline or on-demand recovery events one by one.
 *
 * A single historical event may belong to an older Malink protocol or may be
 * malformed independently of the Matrix cursor surrounding it. Treating the
 * whole page as atomic makes that event a permanent head-of-line blocker: the
 * cursor never advances, so later command completions and notifications are
 * never observed. Security failures remain rejected by the event decoder; the
 * Later events in the same page are applied before each failed event receives
 * one retry, so an out-of-order dependency can still converge without being
 * discarded. The caller records any remaining bounded fingerprint and
 * converges from authoritative Room State after the page has advanced.
